# Manhunt-1.18-Plus
 Manhunt Datapack based on Dream's Minecraft Challenge

## How to Use

Make a new minecraft world on a server with this datapack in the datapacks folder.

When you join the world for the first time type `/trigger reset`

Type `/trigger get_options` to get some options for the game in chat. You can give the runner some head start time or change the size of the world boarder instead of the default 60 million. I like a world boarder of 10K to prevent the runner from running forever. 

When the runners and hunters have joined the world have the runner type `/trigger start`

Everyone will die but as soon as you respawn the manhunt starts. 

If you ever loose your tracker compass type `/trigger get_compass`
